This is an interview project for AI engineer of a **SECRET COMPANY**.

## Targets
- [x] reproduce the results of resnet on Cifar10 with pytorch.
- [x] convert pytorch model to caffe2 model
- [ ] predict image with c++ project organized by `cmake`


## Reproduce
Reproducing is easy, just implement the resnet and train it with suggested super parameters.

To evaluate the accuracy on test dataset for resnet20, just run:
```
git https://github.com/shellhue/Cifar10.git && cd Cifar10
python evaluate.py --layers=20 --weights='./weights/resnet20_164.pth'
```

The corresponding error is:
```
8.33%  (target is 8.75%)
```

To evaluate the accuracy on test dataset for resnet56, just run:
```
git https://github.com/shellhue/Cifar10.git && cd Cifar10
python evaluate.py --layers=56 --weights='./weights/resnet56_164.pth'
```

The corresponding error is:
```
6.83%  (target is 6.97%)
```

## Convert to caffe2
To convert pytorch model to caffe2 model, two steps are needed.

First, convert pytorch model to onnx model:
```
python convert2onnx.py --layers=20 --pretrained_weights='./weights/resnet20_164.pth' // resnet20.onnx will be created
```

Second, convert onnx model to caffe2 model:
```
python onnx2pb.py --layers=20 --onnx_proto_file='pathToOnnxProtoFile' // onnx-init-20.pb and onnx-predict-20.pb will be created
```

## Predict with c++
I havenâ€™t finished this. But i know how to do it.
Just follow [caffe2_cpp_tutorial](https://github.com/leonardvandriel/caffe2_cpp_tutorial), and then change the `pretrained.cc` in dir `/src/caffe2/binaries/` to use the `onnx-init-20.pb onnx-predict-20.pb`  files. Unfortunately, it is hard to make `caffe2_cpp_tutorial`run. I find that installing `caffe` by building the source is needed, but the installation is very slow. And i have no time!!
